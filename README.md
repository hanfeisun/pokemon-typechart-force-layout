Demo: https://hanfeisun.github.io/pokemon-typechart-force-layout/

A quick-and-dirty 10-minute hack to visualize the intricate [Pokemon Type Chart](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type#Type_chart). 


For cleaness, only **A-super-effective-against-B** relationship is displayed in the graph. **A-not-so-effective-again-B** and **A-immune-to-B** relationship is not shown.
